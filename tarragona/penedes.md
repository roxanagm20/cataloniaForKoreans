# El Penedès
<br>

Between Barcelona and Tarragona stretches a vast plans gently sloping towards the beaches of the Costa Dorada: the Penedès.

The Penedès is, indeed, an immense vineyard that runs without discontinuity from the gates of Barcelona to the lands of Tarragona.

The best known wines are produced in the vicinity of Sant Sadurní d'Anoia; wines that have "turned" into champagne the great production of which, exported today all over the world, has a constant increase.
